# Why resilience matters

Most outages are not caused by a single bug. They are the sum of small, predictable failures lining up in unpredictable ways. Resilience is the discipline of preparing our software for that reality.

## Principles we apply

- Avoid single points of failure
- Prefer bounded concurrency to unbounded parallelism
- Fail fast at the edges, degrade gracefully at the core
- Make the easy path the safe path

### Defensive defaults

Configuration should bias toward safety. Timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers must be explicit and modest by default. Overly generous timeouts accumulate and turn local hiccups into global stalls.

```ts
// Example: a safe fetch wrapper
export async function safeFetch(input: RequestInfo, init: RequestInit & { timeoutMs?: number } = {}) {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), init.timeoutMs ?? 3000);
  try {
    const res = await fetch(input, { ...init, signal: controller.signal });
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${res.status}`);
    return res;
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
  }
}
```

## Failure modes to design for

1. Network partitions and latency spikes
2. Dependency outages (databases, third‑party APIs)
3. Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
4. Thundering herds and retry storms

We cannot prevent all of these, but we can contain their blast radius. Backpressure, rate limiting, and bulkheads are our best tools.

## Testing resilience

Resilience grows where it is exercised. We run chaos drills during low‑traffic windows and document what actually happened.

- Inject latency into critical paths
- Kill pods randomly within a replica set
- Expire TLS certificates in staging and practice the rollover

The output of a drill is not a new dashboard. It is a concrete change: a smaller timeout, a better alarm, or a simpler dependency.

## Operating a resilient system

Clear, quiet observability beats loud dashboards. We focus on four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Alarms page engineers only when a user‑visible objective is violated.

Resilience is not a checklist. It is an organizational habit of asking “what if?” and then making the answer a little less scary.
