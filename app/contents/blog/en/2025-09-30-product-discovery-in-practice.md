Great discovery work narrows uncertainty before we scale delivery. Shipping is not the finish line; learning is.

## Four risks to shrink

- Value risk: Will anyone care?
- Usability risk: Can people use it?
- Feasibility risk: Can we build it with the time and people we have?
- Business viability: Should we, given pricing, compliance, and brand?

## Lightweight artifacts that work

We bias toward artifacts that speed up conversations.

- One‑page problem brief
- Journey sketch with painful moments highlighted
- Figma click‑through with a success metric
- A data pull that shows the shape and scale of the problem

## Cadence

Weekly rituals keep discovery honest: customer calls, internal demos, and a 30‑minute retro on what we learned, not what we did. The goal is fewer surprises, not more documents.

When discovery is healthy, backlogs feel smaller and more obvious. People stop arguing about opinions and start editing the prototype together.
