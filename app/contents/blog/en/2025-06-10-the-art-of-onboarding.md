Great onboarding lowers anxiety and increases velocity. It is less about documents and more about momentum.

## Day 0

Ship a welcome email with context: the team mission, current goals, and two very small issues labeled “first‑ship”.

## Day 1–3

- Pair on environment setup and the first PR
- Walk through a production incident from the past quarter
- Schedule 1:1s with peers and adjacent teams

## Day 4–10

The goal is a meaningful contribution by the end of week two. Keep scope tight, celebrate publicly, and leave breadcrumbs in docs for the next person.

Onboarding is when culture is most legible. Make it generous.
