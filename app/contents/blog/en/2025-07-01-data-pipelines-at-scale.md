Data systems fail at the seams: duplicate events, schema drift, late arrivals. Mature pipelines acknowledge this and make disagreement explicit.

## Ingestion

Accept that producers are imperfect. Enforce contracts at the edge and quarantine bad events. Prefer idempotent writes and explicit dedupe keys.

## Transformation

Keep transformations simple and composable. Favor small, wellâ€‘named steps over sprawling jobs. Document invariants alongside the code.

## Delivery

Downstream consumers want three things: completeness, timeliness, and explainability. If you have to pick two, publish a clear SLO.

```sql
-- Example: snapshot stable columns and keep a change stream for the rest
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW users_v1 AS
SELECT id, name, email, last_login_at
FROM users_source
WHERE _is_valid = true;
```

Great pipelines make the data boring and the insights interesting.
